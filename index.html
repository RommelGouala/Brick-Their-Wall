            <h2> About This Game</h2>
        <p>Brick Their Walls is a remake of the game Breakout. Breakout was created in 1976. It was released as an enhanced version of Atari's first Pong game. (The game where you play table tennis with two rectangles on the screen.)</p>
        <p>Although Brick their walls is similar to Breakout, they have their differences from Breakout. I was inspired by Breakout to make this remake. This game is full of different features: Enlarge or duplicate the paddle (will be added) etc. Have fun and play with pleasure.</p>
