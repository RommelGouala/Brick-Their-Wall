# Brick-Their-Wall
    This is Retro Brick wall game. Brick Their Walls is a remake of the game Breakout. Breakout was created in 1976. It was released as an enhanced version of Atari's first Pong game. (The game where you play table tennis with two rectangles on the screen.)
    Although Brick their walls is similar to Breakout, they have their differences from Breakout. I was inspired by Breakout to make this remake.
    When I was younger, I had a game box where I could play retro games. I always wondered how it was programmed; So I decided to program the game myself. I first did this in high school using the Scratch website. Now I've done it again but this time using Html, Css and Javascript - three recent skills I learned.

    I wanted the game to be different, and that's why there are different features in the game. One of the features is the reverse direction of the landing paddle - pretty much if the player wants the ball to go to left, the player must ensure that the ball lands on the right side of the paddle. Why did I do it like this?
     Well, I wanted to do a little challenge.
    I will also mention that each time the player completes a Gate (the Gate represents the level), the speed will increase by 0.7.

    I will add more features in the future such as: clone paddle, expand paddle, downtime, rewrite reality, add more life by player's will, add energy bar...
    At this moment the review does not work. I have not learn Back-End yet.
    I will explain everything in the future, but for now enjoy the game as it is.
